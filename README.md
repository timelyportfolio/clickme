# clickme

**clickme** is an R package that makes JavaScript visualizations using R data objects as input. Its goal is to make interactive visualizations as easy to use as the base `plot` function.

Instead of static JS files, clickme works with [**ractives**](https://github.com/nachocab/clickme/wiki/Ractive-Structure) (short for *interactives*â€”a hat tip to [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age)), which are simple folder structures that contain a **template** file used to populate the JS code with R input data. This model makes visualizations easy to access and reuse within R.

## Quick Usage

Run this in your R session to install or update to the latest version of clickme:

```S
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("knitr", repos = "http://www.rforge.net/", type = "source")

library(devtools)
install_github("clickme", "nachocab")
```

Now you can try the examples:

```S
library(clickme)

# visualize the same dataset in different ways using Vega
data <- data.frame(x = 1:20, y = c(28,55,43,91,81,53,19,87,52,48,24,49,87,66,17,27,68,16,49,15))
clickme_vega(data, "area")
clickme_vega(data, "bar")
clickme_vega(data, "scatter")

# visualize a (funky) zoomable phylogenetic tree (www.onezoom.org)
mammals_path <- system.file(file.path("examples", "one_zoom", "data", "mammals.tree"), package="clickme")
clickme(mammals_path, "one_zoom")

# visualize a force-directed interactive graph
items <- paste0("GENE_", 1:40)
n <- 30
df1 <- data.frame(a = sample(items, n, replace = TRUE), b = sample(items, n, replace = TRUE), type = sample(letters[1:3], n, replace=TRUE))
clickme(df1, "force_directed")

# visualize a line plot that allows zooming along the x-axis
n <- 30
cities <- c("Boston", "NYC", "Philadelphia")
df2 <- data.frame(name = rep(cities, each = n), x = rep(1:n, length(cities)), y = c(sort(rnorm(n)), -sort(rnorm(n)),sort(rnorm(n))))
clickme(df2, "line_with_focus")

# visualize an interactive heatmap next to a parallel coordinates plot
df3 <- matrix(rnorm(200), ncol = 8,nrow = 25)
rownames(df3) <- paste0("GENE_", 1:25)
colnames(df3) <- paste0("sample_", 1:8)
clickme(df3, "longitudinal_heatmap") # you will need to have a local server for this one. Try running python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Acknowledgements
Thank you **Mike Bostock** for creating the [D3.js][] library. Being able to use it more effectively is the main reason why I developed clickme.

Thank you **Yihui Xie** for building the [knitr][] R package. Even though clickme only uses knitr as a templating engine, it is the most important part of my daily workflow.

## Contributing
If you can see the potential of clickme as a bridge between the R and JS worlds, please contribute by building a ractive, [reporting an issue](https://github.com/nachocab/clickme/issues), or improving the source code.
